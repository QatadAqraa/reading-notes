## Today I learn about Structure in HTML :
1. HTML pages are text documents.
2. HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
3. Tags are often referred to as elements.
4. Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
5. Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
6. Attributes require a name and a value.
7. To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.

## Today I learn about Extra Markup in HTML :
1. DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
2. You can add comments to your code between the markers.
3. The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
4. The div tag  and span tag elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
5. iframes tag cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
6. The meta tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
7. Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.

## Today I learn about HTML5 Layout in HTML :
1. The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.
2. The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple div tag elements).
3. Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
4. To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.

## Today I learn about Process & Design in HTML :
1. It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
2. Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
3. Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
4. Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
5. You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
6. You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.

## Today I learn about The ABC of Programming in JS :

A : What is a script and how do I create one  ?
1. A script is a series of instructions that the computer ca follow in order to achieve a goal.
2. Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions
3. Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically.
4. To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

B : How do computers fit in with the world around them ?
1. computers create models of the world using data.
2. The models use objects to represent physical things. Objects can have: properties that tell us about the object; methods that perform tasks using th properties of thet object; events which are triggered when a user interacts with the computer.
3. Programmers can write code th say "when this event occurs, run that code."
4. Web browsers use HTML markup to create a model of the web page. Each element creates its own node (which is a kind of object).
5. To make web pages interactive, you write code that uses the browser's model of the web page.
