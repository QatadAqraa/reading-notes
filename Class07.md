## Today I learn about Domain Modeling :
Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.

some tips to follow when building my own domain models.
1. When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
2. Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
3. Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
4. Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
5. Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
6. Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

## Today I learn about Tables in HTML :
1. The table tag element is used to add tables to a web
page.
2. A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created
with the tr tag element.
3. Inside each row there are a number of cells
represented by the td tag element (or th tag if it is a
header).
4. You can make cells of a table span more than one row
or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
5. For long tables you can split the table into a thead tag,
tbody tag, and tfoot tag.

## Today I learn about Functions, Methods, and Objects in JS :
1. Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window.
2. JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
3. Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).
