## Today I learn about Text in HTML :
1. HTML elements are used to describe the structure of
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
2. They also provide semantic information (e.g. where
emphasis should be placed, the definition of any
acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

## Today I learn about Introducing CSS in HTML :
1. CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.
2. Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).
3. Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.
4. Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
5. CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.

## Today I learn about Basic JavaScript Instructions in JS :
1. A script is made up of a series of statements. Each
statement is like a step in a recipe.
2. Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,
you might specify that a value must be remembered
before creating a calculation using that value.
3. Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
information used in the script.
4. Arrays are special types of variables that store more
than one piece of related information.
5. JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
6. Expressions evaluate into a single value.
7. Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

## Today I learn about Decisions and Loops in JS :
1. Conditional statements allow your code to make
decisions about what to do next.
2. Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)
are used to compare two operands.
3. Logical operators allow you to combine more than one
set of comparison operators.
4. if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code
if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
