## Today I learn about Links in HTML :
1. Links are created using the a tag element.
2. The a tag element uses the href attribute to indicate
the page you are linking to.
3. If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
4. You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the "to" field.
5. You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.

## Today I learn about Layout in HTML :
1. div tag elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.
2. Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
3. The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
4. Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
5. Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
6. Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
7. CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
8. You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

## Today I learn about Functions, Methods, and Objects in Js :
1. Functions allow you to group a set of related
statements together that represent a single task.
2. Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required
to do their job) and may return a value.
