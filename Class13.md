## Today I learn about THE PAST, PRESENT & FUTURE OF LOCAL STORAGE FOR WEB APPLICATIONS : 
Historically, web applications have had none of these luxuries. Cookies were invented early in the web’s history, and indeed they can be used for persistent local storage of small amounts of data. But they have three potentially dealbreaking downsides:
1. Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby slowing down your web application by needlessly transmitting the same data over and over
2. Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby sending data unencrypted over the internet (unless your entire web application is served over SSL)
3. Cookies are limited to about 4 KB of data — enough to slow down your application (see above), but not enough to be terribly useful
What we really want is:
1. a lot of storage space
2. on the client
3. that persists beyond a page refresh
4. and isn’t transmitted to the server
Before HTML5, all attempts to achieve this were ultimately unsatisfactory in different ways.
### INTRODUCING HTML5 STORAGE
hat I will refer to as “HTML5 Storage” is a specification named Web Storage, which was at one time part of the HTML5 specification proper, but was split out into its own specification for uninteresting political reasons. Certain browser vendors also refer to it as “Local Storage” or “DOM Storage.” The naming situation is made even more complicated by some related, similarly-named, emerging standards that I’ll discuss later in this chapter.
So what is HTML5 Storage? Simply put, it’s a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser. Like cookies, this data persists even after you navigate away from the web site, close your browser tab, exit your browser, or what have you. Unlike cookies, this data is never transmitted to the remote web server (unless you go out of your way to send it manually). Unlike all previous attempts at providing persistent local storage, it is implemented natively in web browsers, so it is available even when third-party browser plugins are not.
Which browsers? Well, the latest version of pretty much every browser supports HTML5 Storage… even Internet Explorer!
